# You Don't Know JS (YDKJS) Series Notes

## Introduction

Welcome to the You Don't Know JS (YDKJS) series! These notes cover "Up & Going," an introductory book in the series that explores fundamental programming concepts through the lens of JavaScript.

### Overview

"Up & Going" is designed to introduce basic programming concepts, especially for those new to JavaScript or programming in general. It provides a foundational understanding of programming principles, laying the groundwork for comprehending subsequent titles in this series.

## Chapter Overviews

- **Chapter 1:** Offers a high-level overview of programming principles, aimed at beginners. Serves as a starting point for further exploration.
- **Chapter 2:** Introduces JavaScript's programming style and concepts. Provides a glimpse into JavaScript programming but is not exhaustive.

## Code Fundamentals

### Program Structure

- **Statements:** Instructions to the computer, composed of variables, literals, and operators.
- **Expressions:** Building blocks of statements, encompassing references to variables, values, and operators.

### Executing Programs

- Programs need to be executed, either interpreted or compiled, to translate code into computer-readable commands.

### Working with Code

- The book emphasizes practicing code examples directly in the developer console. Examples guide through the process of running code snippets for better comprehension.

### Output and Input

- `console.log(..)` prints output to the console.
- `alert(..)` shows a popup with the specified content for user interaction.
- `prompt(..)` captures user input through a pop-up prompt.

### Operators

- Represent actions on variables and values, including arithmetic, assignment, and logical operations.
- Essential operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`, `&&`, `||`, etc.

### Values & Types

- Covers JavaScript primitive types: numbers, strings, booleans, and literals for these types.

### Converting Between Types

- JavaScript offers ways to coerce values between different types, like converting strings to numbers using `Number(..)`.
- Implicit type coercion occurs in certain operations, converting values to facilitate comparison.
